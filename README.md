# Exam Creation Interface

## What We Built

We created an intuitive Exam Creation Interface that allows users to:
- Define exam details such as name, duration, and question picking method.
- Add and manage topics with varying difficulty levels.
- Set scoring criteria and negative marking options.

## Optimization Techniques

To enhance performance and user experience, we implemented the following optimization techniques:
- **Code Splitting**: This allows us to load only the necessary code for the current page, improving load times.
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded only when they are needed, reducing the initial load time.

## Installation and Running Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the necessary dependencies for the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
