# Exam Creation Interface

This project is a modern web application built with React, designed to facilitate the creation of exams with customizable settings and topics.

## What We Built

We created an intuitive Exam Creation Interface that allows users to:
- Define exam details such as name, duration, and question picking method.
- Add and manage topics with varying difficulty levels.
- Set scoring criteria and negative marking options.

## Optimization Techniques

To enhance performance and user experience, we implemented the following optimization techniques:
- **Code Splitting**: This allows us to load only the necessary code for the current page, improving load times.
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded only when they are needed, reducing the initial load time.
- **Minification**: We minified our JavaScript and CSS files to decrease their size, which speeds up loading times.

## Installation and Running Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the necessary dependencies for the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
